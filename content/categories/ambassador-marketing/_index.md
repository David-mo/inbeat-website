Building a brand ambassador program isn’t an easy task. It takes time and effort, and at times, it is almost impossible to predict how things will unfold. But there are valuable lessons we gained from our experience in building brand ambassador programs. To understand what we have done right, we analyzed our successes and failures and well-known brand ambassador programs like American Express and The North Face in detail and wrote down our insights on what makes them work so well.

People choose brands that they like and trust, not just those that are easy or convenient. It takes time to earn the loyalty of your customers. A loyal customer base is more than just a list of names, customer support tickets, or social media followers. Every individual in your customer base should feel personally connected to your brand, feel part of the community you’ve created together and be ready to defend you at all times. Trust, integrity and a shared purpose are at the foundation of successful brand ambassador programs. In these articles, you will learn how to build your own.
