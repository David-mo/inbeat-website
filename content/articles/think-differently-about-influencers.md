##### Behind every influencer lies a creator

When we think of influencer marketing,  we tend to think of a marketing channel; a means of distribution. How many people will our collaboration reach? How many sales will it generate? Although there is logic to such thinking, it does not fully utilize the influencer’s potential. 

What if we were to treat these influencers as part of our brand’s creative process? **Let me explain.**

Creating high-quality visuals routinely is hard. I have worked with clients running paid media at scale, and content creation is a common problem. The pain is deep. Every organization needs imaginative content which will help the brand stand out. But how?

To make our jobs even harder, we know that User-Generated Content (UGC) outperforms studio-quality content. 

But why? It’s more relatable? It’s different? Who knows. 

We become blind to ads as consumers, making UGC centric advertising a logical approach. **Your brand needs a way to produce UGC on a regular basis.**

For the rest, let us think of influencers as creators. Forgo engagement, followers, subscribers or whichever quantitative metric you use. Creativity and aesthetics are our only benchmarks. This is the turn we took for our clients and it has changed our business completely.

## What’s the Problem?

Your marketing department is worn out. Your ads are more of the same. You’ve hired professional creators to spice-up your advertising, but the results don’t stick. You continuously try to spark novelty across your team, but the everyday grind gets the best of you.

**Content creation is a painful process.**  We ask of our marketing department to be creative, but we contradictorily assign them to operations-driven work (newsletter, website banner, product description, etc.). The execution of such tasks is crucial to a business’s success. However, It becomes hard for any person to be creative while trapped in the usual flow of everyday to-dos.

How can we move past this state of staleness? 

Let me frame the question through the lens’ of a marketing executive in this situation: **how can we generate high-quality and imaginative content on-demand?** 

## The Answer

Build a business process! *Cliché?* In a sense. What we need is a scalable (I want more content for the Holiday season) and repeatable (I want new content anytime I need it) solution.

#### Let’s breakdown the process: Discover new influencers

1. Pitch and negotiate
2. Onboard and brief
3. Gather feedback

In a nutshell, we want to find “outside-the-box thinking” creators, contact and brief them. We also want to get their feedback on our product throughout the process.  I will be covering ways of communicating with creators later in this article.

#### So, how can we get the best results?

1. Find influencers from different **sub-niches**. Diversity breeds novelty (a parachute junky will have a different take on your product than a yoga master).
2. **Focus on micro-influencers**. Multiple niche creators use social media to share their craft with a small group of like-minded people. Don’t attribute importance to the size of the audience, as it has little relevance in our use-case. Aesthetics and creativity are our guiding light.

> **Side Note** : By framing influencer marketing as a way to crowdsource a part of your creative process, you will need to invest more time on relationships than a typical influencer campaign. A traditional influencer marketing campaign is usually transactional and requires less handling. 

**How should you communicate with your creators?**

## Getting The Best Out Of Your Influencers

As marketers, we love Adwords and Facebook ads; what’s better than a plug and play system which gives you instant feedback on your performance? 

Treating our process as such is a sure way to fail. We are dealing with people, and like with any relationship, we need to think beyond the transaction. It is your job to empower your army of creative consultants. The more thoughtful you are about this, the better your output.

#### High-level Guidelines

Within our agency, we give guidelines on the format and the elements of the product we want to be displayed (unique selling proposition, packaging, etc.). It is easy to be too restrictive and drag your fresh-minded creator into your tunnel-visioned worldview. **We want outside the box content, not more of the same.**
