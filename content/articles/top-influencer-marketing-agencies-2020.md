But, the world of influencers is hard to navigate alone. To maximize the ROI of your campaigns, you need to select <strong>the best influencer marketing agency </strong>that will set you up for success.</p><p>In this article, we will explain what an influencer marketing agency does and review the best agencies in 2020.</p><h3 id="what-does-an-influencer-marketing-agency-do">What Does an Influencer Marketing Agency Do?</h3><p>Influencer marketing campaigns are complex and challenging to plan and execute. Successful campaigns have many variables. They include optimization, vetting, structuring, contract negotiations, content reviews. These variables are hard to manage without relevant experience and resources.</p><p>Influencer marketing agencies work together with brands to plan, execute, and manage influencer marketing campaigns. Top influencer marketing agencies have close relationships with the leading creators.

Ask for relevant case studies and analyze the influencers an agency works with. Some agencies specialize in collaborations with celebrity influencers. As a result, they charge very high fees for their service. Smaller brands looking to reach highly targeted audiences should instead consider working with agencies with an extensive micro-influencers network. They have higher engagement than celebrity influencers and will keep your campaign spend low.</p><p>Understanding what type of campaigns and influencers the agency is comfortable with will allow you to evaluate the agency's capacity to deliver the best results for you.</p><p><strong>Understand their work process and how transparent they are about the strategies they deploy.</strong></p><p>Top influencer marketing agencies can explain in detail how they handle new campaigns, including their criteria to select influencers and platforms.
