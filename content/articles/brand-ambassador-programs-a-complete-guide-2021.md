Think<a href="https://medium.com/@igorbatko/growthstory-how-transferwise-is-building-a-new-global-financial-services-brand-96ec973a082e"> Transferwise</a>.</p><p>Using your customers and employees as brand ambassadors means pondering these questions:</p><ul><li>Can your brand empower these people?</li><li>Does your brand have a strong culture?</li><li>Can an employee still be your brand ambassador after leaving the company? Hint: probably not if they go to the competition.</li></ul><p>Probably most important of all:</p><p><strong>What if one of your customers is using both your product and the competing brands?</strong></p><p>The answer is complicated, but you can make things work if your brand ambassador uses an indirect competitor’s products. That way, they can highlight different purposes for each item.</p><p><strong>Before you settle on your brand ambassadors, consider these issues:</strong></p><ul><li>Their personality</li><li>The channels they’ll use</li><li>The messages they’ll disseminate</li><li>Whether brand ambassadors should post original content or you will provide them with visuals and captions</li><li>If the brand ambassador fits your brand’s image, personality, and values</li></ul><p>Once you have a profile all set, here’s how you’ll find your ambassadors:</p><ul><li>On your social media: the people who are most vocal about your brand. Make sure these people can influence and engage others.</li><li>At a networking event</li><li>In your customers’ database</li></ul><p>Or you can choose one of the best online tools on the market:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.inbeat.co/">inBeat:</a> best for Tik-Tok and Instagram.

Goals.</strong> Structure your brand ambassador program by setting your goals. We already discussed that above. Make sure you evaluate your current position first and that you set SMART objectives.</p><p><strong>2. KPIs.</strong> Key performance indicators can include:</p><ul><li>Ambassador’s reach</li><li>Their traffic</li><li>The revenue your brand ambassadors will bring in.</li><li>The new social media activity about your campaign</li><li>New social media messages during the campaign</li><li>The number of likes, comments, and shares. These variables represent engagement</li><li>The number of brand ambassadors disseminating your messages</li><li>The number of influencers not living up to their part of the deal</li></ul><p><strong>3. Strategies.</strong> Use these KPIs to set the right strategies, tactics, and instruments. Consider each of your messages carefully and review the best channels according to your audience’s profile. For example, you can use:</p><ul><li>Messages that trigger your customers’ curiosity</li><li>Inspirational and motivational posts</li><li>Original content from your customers</li><li>Polls</li><li>Tips-and-tricks articles</li><li>Competitions</li><li>Roasts</li></ul><p><strong>4. Measure the results.</strong> You can measure brand awareness by considering social media engagement and organic participation. You can also track sales effortlessly if you give your brand ambassadors personalized promo codes and links. Or, you can use lots of tools like Instagram tracking, Google Analytics, and inBeat tracking.</p><p><strong>Craving for more details about building an effective brand ambassador campaign?</strong> You can read our complete guide for brand ambassador programs<a href="https://www.inbeat.co/articles/brand-ambassador-programs-a-complete-guide-2021/"> here</a>.</p><h3 id="create-brand-ambassador-policies-and-guidelines">Create Brand Ambassador Policies And Guidelines</h3><p>Make sure your brand ambassadors do what they’re supposed to by drafting a contract. Here’s what these policies and guidelines should include:</p><ul><li>Exclusive rights if you don’t want your brand ambassadors to be the voice of your competition as well</li><li>Repurposing rights to make sure you can use their content whenever you need</li><li>The results that your brand ambassadors should bring in.

For example, for the Mogo.ca campaign, we collaborated with a YouTuber Carter Sullivan who created series of videos about Mogo and its benefits. This long-term collaboration was possible only because we put effort into building relationships with this creator.</p><p>That means:</p><ul><li>You have to be available for them and respond within 24 hours.</li><li>Keep them in the loop of your campaign.</li><li>Share new deals and products with your ambassadors.</li><li>Ask for their feedback about your products and brand.</li><li>Ask what they would do differently.</li><li>Outline your expectations precisely and offer ambassadors constructive feedback as well.</li><li>Create a safe space where your customers and brand ambassadors can meet, such as Facebook Groups.</li><li>Post your brand ambassadors’ content on your social media, website, and product pages. As you recognize their efforts, you’re building a stronger bond.</li></ul><h3 id="create-a-brand-ambassador-program-with-great-rewards">Create A Brand Ambassador Program With Great Rewards</h3><p><strong>Awesome rewards equal better pieces.</strong></p><p>You need to have a great reward system in place to keep your brand ambassadors motivated. If you’re only rewarding them when they bring in more sales, your ambassadors will tend to give up.</p><p>Unfortunately, that means they won’t generate as much awareness as you need.</p><p><strong>Here’s what you need to consider:</strong></p><ul><li>When and how often you’re repaying the ambassadors</li><li>Payment method: money, goodie bags, exclusive invitations, first dibs</li><li>Result indicators</li></ul><p>These rewards should keep your ambassadors engaged. Therefore, you have to combine them with excellent communication and other insightful tools.</p><p>One of those tools is game theory. Various platforms use it to motivate your ambassadors through a mix of timely rewards, design particularities, and praises.</p><p><strong>It’s not enough to reward your ambassadors. You should also hook them.</strong></p><p>That’s why you should consider an operational team that takes care of planning and execution.</p><p>Besides, you don’t want to forget about sending them their rewards, do you? Because if you lose trust and don’t fulfill your promises, your ambassadors will leave.</p><p>inBeat is here to help. We already told you that our Tik-Tok and Instagram databases are free, right? Get in touch<a href="https://app.inbeat.co/get-started"> here</a>.</p><h3 id="brand-ambassador-program-examples">Brand Ambassador Program Examples</h3><p>Brand ambassador programs are the new and improved use-a-celebrity marketing tactic. They help you build the face of your brand, thus making it more relatable to your audience. Here’s why:</p><p>Brand ambassadors share a personal connection with your brand. When they become your brands’ spokespeople, they build stories around your company. As this organic enthusiasm protrudes your audience’s subconscious minds, more people will buy your products.</p><p>We’ll discuss some brand ambassador examples below and the lessons you can learn from each.</p><h3 id="1-maybelline-it-girls">1. Maybelline It Girls</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/7Sf1ThZQs2q6uk_PUfO0dgIWJJ5bbKOALLASYRsLr1P4lDHpR-8fDHAvVk8Orwg7GcJWFA7c1e3AkGOYEar2YnilmXeG1nE-ncfHmrCEL_HnuwYpO_XHZNrlxBEKku2l8Zi5Eb-7" class="kg-image" alt="Maybelline brand ambassador program"></figure><p>Maybelline It Girls is one of the best examples of showcasing a compact team of brand ambassadors. These people <strong>share sincere opinions about Maybelline</strong> with their followers because they have direct experience with this brand.</p><p>Case in point: the New York Fashion Week.</p><p>Maybelline reunited essential brand ambassadors that fit with their brand and have high levels of trust:</p><ul><li>Make-up artists</li><li>Models</li><li>Influencers</li></ul><p>Here’s why this strategy works:</p><p><strong>1. Young women see glamorous models they resonate with.</strong></p><p>One example is Victoria Kimani, a famous singer and songwriter from Kenya. She symbolizes equality, hope, and strong femininity in a world now defined by the BLM awareness movement. To this extent, her posts juxtapose Maybelline and #blackgirlmagic. Therefore, BLM supporters – mainly Gen Z – are more likely to buy Maybelline products.</p><p><strong>2. Other tactics that support this strategy include regular posts about Maybelline and event photos.</strong> Maybelline features their ambassadors all the time, on its website, its social media, and so forth. Each ambassador speaks from their heart, making sure to connect the brand with its potential customers.</p><p><strong>3. The brand’s ambassadors receive a name.</strong> This strategy is powerful not just because it builds recognition. The name helps build an ideal, as more people want to become like these ambassadors. Besides, this name defines the Maybelline community with its stories and values.</p><p>But here’s the crucial aspect:</p><p>When you’re defining a community of loyal members, you’re also separating it from outsiders. That way, you’re:</p><ul><li><strong>Strengthening the feeling of belonging. </strong>Customers are less likely to choose another brand. They’ll also become the voices of your brand as they build organic content.</li><li><strong>Increasing the outsiders’ need to become part of your brand. </strong>This higher demand makes your brand wanted but also exclusive.</li></ul><h3 id="2-mogo-ca-brand-ambassador-program">2. Mogo.ca Brand Ambassador Program</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/912HO2qj_CbqJy14vUV9lbGLE4EHHzQcaxfTQXoaQP1vAdxvHYP1M15jJQXpIZigzBBXaqGC8VmTw-kc_G0FLyoq8WLuEBDfKWSkivrGSqvgQ9dH2d2Q1loyByQOItVN_aa5jUiw" class="kg-image" alt="Mogo.ca brand ambassador program"></figure><p>Mogo employs micro-influencers to advertise their Bitcoin-related products and other services. Inbeat Canada helps Mogo with its brand ambassador programs. Creators like<a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/CarterSullivan/search?query=mogo"> Carter Sullivan</a> have a loyal following of young adults interested in budgeting, finance, and lifestyle:</p><p>Mogo knows that Millenials and Gen-Z are more likely to take an interest in Bitcoin. The bias against these generations is that they’re irresponsible when it comes to financing.</p><p>Here’s what you can learn from the Mogo Ambassador Program:</p><p><strong>1. Become your audience’s number one supporter. </strong>Mogo becomes a supporter of their audience by admitting that, although young adults may have different priorities, they lead organized lifestyles.</p><p><strong>2. Use trustworthy micro-influencers that connect to their audience.</strong> Carter Sullivan relates to her audience because she knows financial education is limited in high school.</p><p>The Mogo app has lots of learning resources on sustainable spending. All these tidbits of information are simple and easy to access, exactly what young adults want.</p><p><strong>3. YouTube is an excellent medium for showing how your product works.</strong> For instance, Carter Sullivan discusses how Mogo helped keep her credit score up. Plus, she did that without cutting back on so-called “unnecessary expenses,” such as coffee dates.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://ghost.inbeat.co/content/images/size/w1000/2021/02/image-3.png" class="kg-image" alt="Mogo.ca brand ambassador program"></figure><p><strong>4. Videos convey emotions through verbal and nonverbal cues.</strong> Micro-influencers on platforms like YouTube can attract more paying customers thanks to their display of emotions because:</p><ul><li><strong>It’s easier to disagree with written text because your brain only perceives information. </strong>Thus, it operates at a rational level.</li><li><strong>Emotions operate at a subconscious level. </strong>If you’re mirroring the speaker’s emotions, you feel what they feel. So, you’re more likely to experience certain products or brands the same way they do.</li></ul><p>Carter Sullivan is very expressive when discussing Mogo. She uses ample hand gestures and widens her eyes to punctuate information. Carter also says “love” frequently when talking about Mogo apps’ services.</p><p><strong>5. Associate your brand with an essential issue in your audience’s life.</strong> Young adults are interested in topics like global warming, so they support eco-friendly brands. That’s why Carter Sullivan explains how Mogo can help people reduce their carbon footprints.</p><p><strong>6. Give something back to your customers.</strong> Have your brand ambassadors explain all the things that your audience gets. Work on Maslow’s pyramid:</p><ul><li><strong>Physiological needs:</strong> Mogo promises free $5 to buy sats when you register, plus Bitcoin cashback when transacting.</li><li><strong>Safety needs: </strong>Mogo keeps your spending habits in check so that you can avoid debt.</li><li><strong>Belongingness: </strong>Improving your spending habits helps you spend more quality time with friends. Besides, you’re a responsible global citizen because you’re helping reduce the Planet’s carbon footprint.</li><li><strong>Esteem needs: </strong>Mogo’s customers benefit from personal improvement through financial education.</li><li><strong>Self-actualization: </strong>You’re becoming a better person through your improved habits and knowledge.</li></ul><h3 id="3-amex-brand-ambassadors">3.

The strategy is to speak to as many audiences as possible. Thus, American Express uses micro-influencers from all industries.</p><p><strong>But here’s the gist:</strong></p><p>Everyone needs a credit card. Whether you’re a teacher, business owner, or globetrotter, you need the best offers.</p><p>Amex ambassadors’ Instagram posts work because they emphasize usability. For example, Julia Engel is a popular micro-influencers known for her travel and fashion advice. Her ambassador posts discuss the advantages of Amex Platinum when traveling abroad.</p><p>Here’s what you can learn from this example:</p><p><strong>1. Employ micro-influencers that use your brand</strong> because they have first-hand experience with it. They can show your audience how your products work in all possible situations.</p><p><strong>2. Make sure micro-influencers deliver valuable insights.</strong> Your audience wants to understand your product’s competitive edge.</p><p><strong>3. Brand ambassadors should discuss how your products can meet your audience’s core needs. </strong>People don’t care about <em>why</em> your product is excellent. They want to see <em>how</em> it’s excellent <em>for them</em>.</p><p><strong>4. Images have powerful rhetoric.</strong> Mediums like Instagram or YouTube juxtapose text and image, thus imbuing emotions into your narrative.

People like Ashima Shiraishi, Rory Bosio, and Juan Martinez are record-setters, but they have something else in common:</p><p>They’re relatable.</p><p>For example, Rory Bosio was unknown until she won the 104-mile race around Mont Blanc.<a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/real-world-geography-juan-martinez/"> Juan Martinez</a> immigrated from Mexico, where his poor life helped create a powerful connection to the environment.</p><p>So here’s the lesson:</p><p><strong>1. Choose relatable ambassadors that can personify your brand.</strong></p><p>You can do that if you deconstruct your brand on dimensions like:</p><ul><li>Mission and vision</li><li>Values</li><li>Objectives</li></ul><p><strong>2. Remember that the purpose is to find your brand’s archetype.</strong> Next, choose brand ambassadors that represent facets or different personalities of this archetype.</p><p>Notice how North Face’s ambassadors:</p><ul><li>Come from modest backgrounds.</li><li>Are used to living challenging lives.</li></ul><p>As a result, they:</p><ul><li>Crave to push their limits.</li><li>Feel wholly fulfilled outdoors.</li><li>Have a real need to share this feeling with their audience.</li></ul><p><strong>3. Go back to the origins to find the right storytelling tactics.</strong> Once you get relatable micro-influencers that personify your brand, finding the right platform is easy.</p><p>For example, The North Face ambassadors use:</p><ul><li>Documentaries</li><li>Podcasts</li><li>Interviews</li></ul><p>These instruments are powerful because North Face’s audience doesn’t just want pretty sports clothes. They’re passionate about the outdoors, and they want to connect with nature.</p><p><strong>The North Face quenches their thirst for adventure with man’s earliest solution: stories.</strong></p><h3 id="5-phone-loops">5.

This company’s product, aka the straps that attach to your phone, address an essential issue:</p><p>Unlike old Nokia models, smartphones break when they fall.</p><p>So, whenever you choose a brand ambassador, <strong>make sure their content emphasizes your brand’s essential promise.</strong> Repeating this promise is a reliable strategy because:</p><ul><li>Your brand gains notoriety.</li><li>The recall is faster and easier.</li><li>People start believing what you’re saying.</li></ul><p>Here’s why repetition’s main rhetorical result is instilling belief:</p><p>When people first see or hear something, they may be wary. If lots of people use that product, it becomes ordinary. Next, if trustworthy micro-influencers recommend that thing, it becomes desirable.</p><p>So, the Phone Loops primary lesson is:</p><p><strong>If you have a new, innovative product move your audience on these levels:</strong></p><p><strong>Wariness → acceptance → want</strong></p><p>Phone Loops<a href="https://www.instagram.com/phoneloops/"> Instagram strategy</a> was to showcase micro-influencers using their product in lots of everyday situations, such as:</p><ul><li>In planes’ bathrooms</li><li>On boats</li><li>In moving cars</li><li>Taking selfies with their families</li></ul><p>You can see hundreds of such pictures and videos. Brand ambassadors recommend this product, with excellent insight into its uses.</p><p><strong>Most importantly, micro-influencers share relatable problems that Phone Loops helped solve.</strong></p><p>Here are other lessons from Phone Loops if you have an innovative product:</p><p>1.      Explain how it works to dispel wariness.</p><p>2.      Show your brand ambassadors using this product in various situations to build acceptance. Make sure to get lots of ambassadors, too. For example, Inbeat hires 100+ brand ambassadors for Phone Loops each month.</p><p>3.      Try an online game or dare to instill want. For example, Phone Loops has the “selfie game.”</p><p>The brand ambassador examples above work because they employ several tactics to build a loyal audience.</p><p>Martin Lindstrom discussed this over a decade ago when he compared brands to religion.</p><p>This comparison may seem exaggerated, but you can notice some of its points in the strategies we discussed above.</p><p><strong>One example is building an archetype for your brand.</strong> Your brand ambassadors are not only your voices; they personify your values – that’s what Carter Sullivan did for Mogo.</p><p><strong>Another example is building a common narrative through various “legends.”</strong> North Face does that each time it publishes another one of its athlete’s stories. Customers identify with these legends and create their own.</p><p><strong>Giving a name to your community of loyal followers</strong> is also crucial to create a sense of belonging to a group. That’s what Maybelline does with its “Maybelline Girls.”</p><p>But there’s one other thing to remember:</p><p><strong>Choose the right channel to communicate with your audience.</strong></p><p>In the next section, we’ll tell you how to build an Instagram brand ambassador program.</p><h3 id="instagram-brand-ambassador-program">Instagram Brand Ambassador Program</h3><p><strong>Instagram brand ambassador programs</strong> are efficient strategies that can increase your brand’s awareness, reputation, and ROI.

However, this only happens when the brand is already active on social media and influencers see other viral posts or hashtags.</p><p><strong>Here’s a frequent mistake most companies make when contacting potential brand ambassadors:</strong></p><p>They talk endlessly about why their brand is excellent. Next, they start offering all sorts of freebies.</p><p>We’re not saying incentives are inherently wrong, but they can alienate valuable influencers when you’re pushing too hard. Instead, try this:</p><ul><li><strong><strong><strong>Ask potential brand ambassadors for feedback on your brand.</strong></strong></strong></li><li>Tell them why they’d be a valuable partner for your company.</li><li>Explain how you can help each other out. It is the part where you talk about discounts, deals, special offers, etc.</li></ul><p>Surprisingly, that’s the easy part.</p><p><strong>The hard part is to build your Instagram network.</strong> Imagine your brand ambassador program as a train. The carriages click with each other and pull in the same direction at once.</p><p>So, make sure you’re the glue that binds your community of influencers. You can organize online and offline meet-ups, but the crucial element is planning.</p><p>We’ll discuss that below. But first:</p><h3 id="what-should-you-include-in-the-brand-ambassador-agreement">What Should You Include in the Brand Ambassador Agreement?</h3><p>Your brand ambassador agreement should include:</p><ul><li><strong>Exclusive rights</strong> to prevent your brand ambassadors from advertising your competitors’ products</li><li><strong>Repurposing rights </strong>to reuse their content at anytime</li><li><strong>Expected results</strong> accompanied by precise guidelines</li><li><strong>Schedule</strong> with transparent deadlines</li><li><strong><strong><strong>Non-disclosure agreement</strong></strong></strong></li><li><strong>The approval process</strong> to make sure the influencer requests your approval before posting on Insta</li><li><strong>Legal responsibilities </strong>to clarify that you’re not liable if the influencer commits a crime while being your brand ambassador</li><li><strong>Payment procedure </strong>to specify details about payment, such as dates, quantum, and conditions</li></ul><p>You can either sign a printed document or an online one through tools like:</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.docusign.com/">DocuSign</a></li><li><a href="https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/sign.html">Adobe Sign</a></li><li><a href="https://www.pandadoc.com/">Pandadoc</a></li><li><a href="https://signeasy.com/">Sign Easy</a></li></ul><h3 id="how-to-create-a-fun-brand-ambassador-program-that-works">How to Create a Fun Brand Ambassador Program That Works?</h3><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/sBb2g2dzuaUdSjeoySp8cPfUlO0bxzAO4SUPZ7Ah2aQ7yJZEBp7wnPmNEejS2pd8UJB_syKf35wiHHsZAxGJQhXdYA4q6AAgcWzqZ75l2gWZhoxPYaIRQeUVk3uosxybufOrdfwd" class="kg-image" alt="Fun brand ambassador programs"></figure><p>A fun brand ambassador program that works starts with probably the least fun thing in the history of fun things, unless you’re Sheldon Cooper.

Remember that customers have to visit your website to check out products and to fill in the code. Thus, you’ll know how many sales resulted from each ambassador.</p><p><strong>Pro tip: </strong>Use Shopify integration tools to generate and assign these codes.</p><p><strong>Personalized affiliate links. </strong>Each brand ambassador will have their URL to your website’s landing page. Unlike promo codes, affiliate links take customers directly to your landing page. This strategy tells you:</p><ul><li>The number of visits from all affiliate links</li><li>The number of conversions generated through each link</li><li>The number of people visiting  your website after clicking on a particular link and then not purchasing your products. This metric is crucial because it tells you where you could be making improvements</li></ul><p><strong>Pro tip: Personalized affiliate links work for apps and SaaS too.</strong> Give your brand ambassadors unique links to share with their followers. Track your campaign’s success by counting how many app downloads or SaaS sign-ups you’ve got with each link. Don’t forget to assess how many clicks on your affiliate links ended with no purchase.</p><p>Want to learn how to use brand ambassadors for your app?

Arguably, it’s the crucial piece of your puzzle because only motivated people can bring in the right results. Otherwise, even the most stellar campaign plans can fail.</p><p>So how do you do that?</p><p>We’ll discuss seven excellent strategies and share incredible life lessons picked up from major brand campaigns.</p><p>Keep reading!</p><h3 id="recognize-achievements">Recognize Achievements</h3><p>Recognizing someone’s achievements is essential to keep them motivated. Otherwise, your brand ambassadors will feel like they’re undervalued or not good enough to be part of your team.</p><p>The first step to recognizing your ambassadors’ achievements is <strong>personally sending them a message or e-mail.</strong> Congratulate them, but also ask them how they did it. Their experience and feedback could be valuable for other ambassadors.</p><p>Another good idea is to <strong>link to their work on your website and social media.</strong></p><p>Ask your brand ambassadors to use campaign-specific hashtags. This strategy creates a cohesive community around your brand and links you to it.</p><p>You should also <strong>take photos with them at company events</strong>, instead of ignoring them. But that’s just common courtesy.</p><p>Here are two things you might not have thought about:</p><ul><li><strong>Give them a shout every time they do something unique that’s unrelated to your brand.</strong> This way, you’re showing your appreciation to them as people, not as your influencers.</li><li><strong>Show your recognition before they do anything for you.</strong> You can drop them a line or ask them what they think about your brand and products. If you strongly believe that you’re going to have a powerful, long-term connection, announce your relationship publicly.</li></ul><p><a href="https://shop.lululemon.com/ambassadors">Lululemon is an excellent example</a> of what we’ve discussed above. This brand dedicates a section of its website to its influencers, plus it organizes annual events in their honor.</p><h3 id="offer-them-special-deals">Offer Them Special Deals</h3><p>Brand ambassadors are your brand’s voices, so, logically, they should have first dibs at special deals. For instance, you should let them be the first to try a new product or app.</p><p><strong>Carter Sullivan for Mogo</strong> is a fantastic example of first dibs at a new product feature. You can watch her video discussing the new Mogo’s Platinum Visa Card<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JAzte9Gm20E&amp;t=49s"> here</a>.</p><p><strong>As you can see, Carter is very passionate about Mogo.</strong> She loves the way their card looks, and she also enjoys their perks.</p><p>As Carter got the first try of their Platinum Visa Card,<strong> she knows exactly why this card is useful. </strong>Therefore, she explains to customers how this card can help them budget more sustainably and get out of debt faster.</p><p><strong>But here’s the gist:</strong></p><p>Carter made this video after receiving several questions from her followers regarding specific budgeting techniques.</p><p>As a result, Mogo’s Platinum Visa Card swoops the limelight as the best answer to their questions.</p><h3 id="send-them-care-packages">Send Them Care Packages</h3><p>Care packages show your brand ambassadors that you care about them. You might think this strategy works best if you have a beauty brand or flower shop. In this case, it makes sense to offer your brand ambassadors skin lotions and flowers.</p><p>But what if you have a gas station brand? Or you’re selling light bulbs?</p><p>You have to get creative. Even a cup or a T-shirt work as birthday presents, for example.</p><p><strong>Don’t forget to celebrate the essential times in your lives:</strong></p><ul><li>Birthdays</li><li>The day when you first signed the contract</li><li>The day when the brand ambassador’s post first came out</li><li>The most embarrassing post or photo – remember it fondly and with a sense of humor, celebrating it as a life lesson</li></ul><p><strong>Of course, care packages are also good ideas:</strong></p><ul><li>After a major win</li><li>After a major loss</li><li>When your brand ambassador feels overwhelmed or not performing as they should</li></ul><h3 id="treat-them-like-family">Treat Them Like Family</h3><p>Under Armour is an excellent example of how to treat your micro influencers like family. After a challenging period between 2016 and 2018, Under Armour signed Dwayne Johnson, aka The Rock.</p><p>You all know The Rock. He’s charming, buff, and an amazing dad. He’s an excellent face for Under Armour, a brand that relates to the ordinary guys and girls who love exercising.</p><p>But Under Armour did something else that’s amazing:<a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CG-cmijBPZV/"> this brand created a new product, especially for The Rock.</a> We’re talking about wireless headphones that won’t slip out of your ears when you’re exercising.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/jQ8NHzWMdlGUcEt2ZUSPRgO0BSaWgTeAdMNlS7S7_C-FdoYhGuqkarO41MRFc3Yaa8eo1Xh_DbT0VCaj9YW9K6Pt6wvPhe6-1YtfHp1xMUzeC4O_QewIcxD5PMp7oCojnKodo2hU" class="kg-image" alt="Project Rock by Under Armour"></figure><p>Basically, Under Armour took its relationship with The Rock to a new level, making him part of its creation process.</p><p>You don’t have to make your brand ambassadors co-creators, though.</p><p><strong>Maybelline is another terrific example because it shows you the power of using names. </strong>This brand names its customers “babellines,” while all its brand ambassadors are “Maybelline Girls.”</p><p><strong>So how can you treat your brand ambassadors like family?</strong></p><ul><li>Involve them in the creative process. Ask for their input and feedback.</li><li>Show them off on your website and when you’re meeting face to face.</li><li>Keep them in the loop.</li><li>Give them a name that makes them feel special and part of the family. You can give them a similar name to your brand or current campaign, but using hashtags is a good idea too.</li></ul><h3 id="create-an-inner-circle">Create an Inner Circle</h3><p>The Adidas Originals campaign is an excellent example of creating an inner circle. But first, what do you think is the main advantage of this strategy?</p><p>You could think it’s building cohesion and loyalty because you’re creating a group.</p><p><strong>However,</strong><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/160940690900800105"><strong> research</strong></a><strong> shows that creating outsiders is even more critical.</strong> Those outsiders help define your “inner circle” through contrasts. Besides, every outsider will want to become a member of your exclusive group.</p><p><strong>Cue Adidas Originals with their limited edition shoes.</strong> These shoes are region-specific, and Adidas markets them with local influencers. As a result of using pop counterculture, Adidas breathed new life into its classic array of products.</p><p>And, just like you would expect, Adidas is flooded with requests from people who want to become their influencers.</p><h3 id="gamification-incentives">Gamification &amp; Incentives</h3><p>Use an online tool to keep your brand ambassadors engaged, such as<a href="https://www.crewfire.com/"> CrewFire</a>,<a href="https://brandchamp.io/plans/"> BrandChamp</a>, or<a href="https://influitive.com/advocatehub/"> Influitive’s AdvocateHub</a>. These tools ensure that your brand ambassadors feel rewarded and entertained. As a result, they help you build a strong connection with these micro influencers.</p><p>Sounds too good to be true?</p><p><strong>It’s all about science, particularly game theory.</strong> These platforms follow specific algorithms to give influencers incentives at precisely the right moment.</p><p>Therefore, your brand ambassadors will feel motivated to continue working for more perks and mini-rewards. These platforms are as addictive as gaming, for instance, because each time you slay a monster, you get a mini-reward.</p><p><strong>These mini-rewards trigger dopamine releases in people’s brains.</strong> As a result, your brand ambassadors will tend to stay hooked to the platform to get that next dopamine rush.</p><p><strong>Or even better:</strong></p><p>Try a micro influencers agency like <a href="https://www.inbeat.co/engagement-rate-calculator-instagram/">inBeat </a>for that special human touch.</p><h3 id="keep-them-independent">Keep Them Independent</h3><p><a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/real-world-geography-juan-martinez/">Juan Martinez for North Face</a> is a remarkable illustration of how independent micro influencers benefit your brand.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/nUVULTwIMK13uJ8yovUATNnAo8c4y0vAOihpwqzO09JVz2Ebge0jebSr4k_wZfY-2683r9vo7nsnMxcBkl4h_dHEE1F4tuQGesympGPPXM81oMmVZbxOUOfFtsKnNrIDWfGyUCBq" class="kg-image" alt="Juan Martines."><figcaption>Juan Martines. Image Source: <a href="https://www.nationalgeographic.org/article/real-world-geography-juan-martinez/">National Geographic</a></figcaption></figure><p>In fact, North Face’s entire athlete program fits this bill because their brand ambassadors are born in challenging environments. As such, these people want to push their limits to overcome their condition.</p><p>Each time they break another record or do another daring feat outdoors, these people feel a sense of fulfillment.</p><p>North Face’s audience craves the same feeling of exhilaration. Therefore, maneuvering its ambassadors like puppets would be a damaging strategy for North Face.</p><p><strong>You can use this strategy to:</strong></p><ul><li>Let your brand ambassadors have their own stories to show your support.</li><li>Publicize those stories to show you’re proud of your brand ambassadors.</li><li>Use these stories to build legends around your brand and your brand ambassadors. As a result, more people will want to be part of your family.</li><li>Allow your brand ambassadors to come up with their ideas about new posts.</li><li>Take your brand ambassadors’ opinion into account when it comes to new product features.</li><li>Connect your audience to your brand ambassadors through podcasts and interviews.</li></ul><p><br></p>
