# How to Find TikTok Influencers (The Ultimate Guide)

Tik Tok is rapidly becoming a platform of choice for brands seeking to target a Gen Z audience. The platform incentivizes members to make and share short-form videos, between fifteen and sixty seconds in length.



Tik Tok is now at the heart of a new generation of influencers, which rose to fame with the platform. As with any new platform, the engagement for a given post is disproportionately high, which opens the door for early adopters to leverage the situation.



This guide will show youhow to find TikTok influencers for free. If you are seeking to scale your TikTok influencer marketing efforts, I recommend you use a tool, such as inBeat, to help you with the research.

## Who are the TikTok Influencers?

In January 2018, TikTok becomes the #1 free mobile app by downloads on the app store in many countries. A lot of influencers are transitioning from Instagram, and Youtube to TikTok in order to capitalize on the hype.



The platform is also home to new influencers, who didn’t have a following pre-TikTok.



New platforms favor early adopters.We have seen it with Instagram, Facebook, and Youtube. There is undeniably a first mover’s advantage.



Brands should capitalize on this window of opportunity.



Why?

* Costs per influencers are disproportionately low
* Engagement is disproportionately high
* Content quality is disproportionately high



It’s disproportional. We want to leverage the opportunity ASAP. We typically hear marketers talk about the good ol’ days of Facebook when we could drive sales through a Facebook page, without any ad budget. That is how we will talk about TikTok in five years.



## Finding TikTok Influencers by Hashtags

Same to other social media platforms such as Instagram, TikTok provides hashtag research so its users can find content made for their interests. To search influencer accounts based on specific keywords, type each keyword on the “Discover” feature, then use “TOP”, “USERS”, “VIDEO” or “HASHTAG” to find top performing accounts related to your hashtag. Scroll each user profile to make sure the following counts, engagement rate, and creativity match tour needs.



## Finding TikTok Influencers By Location

TikTok features content on the feed based on engagement, interests, and also geography. Here also, the “Discover” tool provided by TikTok is pretty strong and helps you find videos, popular hashtags, or accounts mentioning a specific city, state, or country. You also have the option to filter your preferred language in your profile settings “Content Preferences”.

## Finding TikTok Influencers by Country

You can’t use Tik Tok to find influecers by country specifically. Having said that, you can use inBeat, which allows you to discover influencers by country, or by language. If you want to accomplish this task manually, you will have to look at the country associated with a profile inside the application.

## Finding TikTok Influencers By Follower Count

Finding influencers by follower size inside the app is like finding influencers by country, it is a hit-or-miss scenario. You can use a tool like inBeat to find influencers easily by follower count.

## Calculating TikTok Influencers Engagement Rates

Engagement Rate is the percentage number that shows how much engagement online content receives. It is usually calculated as the sum of likes, comments and shares and then divided by the following size of the influencer.



Here’s the (not so) secret formula:

\[(Number of hearts + number of comments + number of shares) / number of followers]x100

## How to Find TikTok Influencers Email Address

TikTok has had the amazing idea of creating a shortcut to Instagram in each user profile. Basically, every influencer on TikTok provides this shortcut to go to their Instagram page in just one tap.



If your influencer strategy is focusing on email outreach rather than Tiktok or Instagram DMs, you can either:

* Find the email address of the influencer on its TikTok bio
* Find the email address of the influencer on its Instagram bio (1 tap)
* Find the email address of the influencer using the Instagram “Email” snippet. (2 taps)

## Final Word on Finding Tik Tok Influencers

I went through strategies to find influencers that match your needs for your influencer marketing campaign on TikTok. Even if it might be time-consuming to find influencers, trust me, it is worth it.\

If you don’t have the time to scroll through TikTok and browse too many searches, you can also use an all-in-one influencer research tool such as inBeat. With this tool, you directly filter what you are looking for in the Keyword Search Bar, and then you can narrow down your search based on your needs regarding following, count, engagement rate, country, language...
