In this guide, you will learn how to create and run an influencer marketing campaign from A to Z using inBeat.

I will be going through:

3. Searching and filtering influencers
4. Exporting a campaign

## Steps to Using inBeat

### 1. Create an Account

*If you already have an account, you can skip this step.*

Go to [our website](https://www.inbeat.co) and click "Sign up". Once you have signed up, **confirm your email** and login to the platform.

### 2. Create a campaign

The first thing to do is to create a campaign:

Within a campaign, you will be able to add, manage and export your influencers.

You can narrow your search to find the ideal influencers for your campaign. **You can modify your search filters later to narrow or broaden your search.**

### 4. Add influencers to your campaign

The campaign structure makes influencer marketing easier. You can access your selected influencers at any time by clicking on “Manage Selected”.

Click on the bookmark button available on each influencer card to add a profile to your campaign:

### 5. Exporting your influencers

Once you are done adding influencers to a campaign, you can click on the “export list” button. This allows you to export all influencers with their relevant contact information.

### 5. Pitching your influencers

Congratulations, you know have a list of influencers to work with.

When you export your campaign, you will receive a CSV file, which you can add to your favorite CRM tool. We propose using [Mailshake](https://mailshake.com/) or [Gmass](https://www.gmass.co/), but you can use any tool you wish. These tools make pitching influencers much easier to manage.
