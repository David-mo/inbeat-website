Deux par Deux, like most fashion retailers, releases collections two times a year. During those collection launches, things are messy and tend to go fast - the marketing department is juggling with multiple deadlines, and the operations team is catching breaking plates.

The goal for any retailer during that period is to start selling their inventory as fast as possible. As the season moves along, they lose hefty profit margins to discounts and clearance sales. In other words, at the beginning of the season, people are paying more in the name of timing.

Deux par Deux wanted to include micro-influencer marketing into their marketing mix to:

* Generate sales through their network of micro-influencers
* Create content to use across their different marketing channels (Instagram and Facebook ads, email, social media calendar, etc.)

In this article, I will cover how they did so using inBeat.

## 1 - Defining the Right Plan

### How Many Influencers do We Seek?

Deux par Deux wanted 50-60 collaborations and 100+ unique creative assets. 

This means that we should pitch anywhere from 400 to 500 micro-influencers at a 10% to 15% collaboration rate. If more influencers agree to work with us, we will have the ability to choose which influencers we want to work with.

### Who’s the Right Influencer

In Deux par Deux’s case, finding the right influencer is straight forward:

* Mother or/and children
* In North America
* With 10 000 to 25 000 followers
* Engagement rate > 3%

There are multiple reasons we decided to work with micro-influencers: \

1. We wanted each collaboration to cost 150$ in-store credits on average, with each amount varying between 100$ and 200$. In exchange, we require 1 or 2 posts and 1 story, depending on the negotiation.
2. We wanted more content assets to reuse across our marketing.
3. Micro-influencers generate more sales at a lower cost per sale (based on past campaigns we have done).

## 2 - Finding Influencers

Deux par Deux found influencers by using [inBeat](https://inbeat.co), an influencer discovery tool, given the number of influencers they were seeking to work with. Finding 500 influencers by hand is a daunting task they didn’t want to go through.

They filtered their search:

* 5k to 25k followers
* Acceptable engagement rate
* Located in the USA or Canada
* Has email

They needed each influencer to have an email because they wanted to contact them in bulk through Mailshake, a cold emailing tool.

They used three search terms: (1) *mother,*(2) *mom*, and (3) *newborn*, independently. The reason they ran a search with the keyword newborn is that they wanted roughly 10 influencers with a newborn child to promote their baby collection.

## 3 - Pitching the Influencers

Once they finished selecting the influencers, they exported their campaign to a CSV format, which they imported to Mailshake.

They then wrote their pitch and follow-up sequences (3 follow-ups), and they kicked-off the campaign.

Following up is the key to a winning campaign.

* 29 responded at the first follow-up
* 7 responded at the second follow-up
* 5 replied at the third follow-up

As you can see, the campaign is still running, which means they will get more responses in the days to come.

At this point, Deux par Deux negotiating influencers.

## Managing Influencers

Once an influencer has accepted the negotiation, it is time to onboard them. 

A simple Google Form to capture all of the information you need (email, address, name of their children, etc.) will be more than enough. 

Integrate the form to Google Sheets, and you have a database of influencers, as well as an influencer CRM.

You can track anything you want from this spreadsheet:

* Promo codes
* Sales
* Post URLs
* Etc.

## The Results

* Deux par Deux adds 5 new clients per micro-influencer, on average. Given their vertical, the lifetime value of a client is significant
* Deux par Deux has 150+ pieces of original content in many formats (videos, stories, and images), which they can add to their marketing mix
