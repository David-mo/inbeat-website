Deux par Deux, like most fashion retailers, releases collections two times a year. During those collection launches, things are messy and tend to go fast - the marketing department is juggling with multiple deadlines, and the operations team is catching breaking plates.

The goal for any retailer during that period is to start selling their inventory as fast as possible. As the season moves along, they lose hefty profit margins to discounts and clearance sales. In other words, at the beginning of the season, people are paying more in the name of timing.

Deux par Deux wanted to include micro-influencer marketing into their marketing mix to:

* Generate sales through their network of micro-influencers
* Create content to use across their different marketing channels (Instagram and Facebook ads, email, social media calendar, etc.)

In this article, I will cover how they did so using inBeat.

## 1 - Defining the Right Plan

### How Many Influencers do We Seek?

Deux par Deux wanted 50-60 collaborations and 100+ unique creative assets. 

We can expect to close 10% to 15% of the influencers we contact. This means that we need to pitch anywhere from 400 to 500 micro-influencers.

In the case where more influencers agree to work with us, we will have the leverage to choose which influencers we want to work with.

### Who’s the Right Influencer

Deux par Deux decided to work with micro-influencers for multiple reasons:

1. They wanted each collaboration to cost 150$ in-store credits on average, with each amount varying between 100$ and 200$. In exchange, we require 1 or 2 posts and 1 story, depending on the negotiation.
2. They wanted more content assets to reuse across our marketing.
3. Micro-influencers generate more sales at a lower cost per sale (based on past campaigns we have done).

In Deux par Deux’s case, finding the right influencer persona is straight forward:

* Mother or/and children
* In North America
* With 10 000 to 25 000 followers
* Engagement rate > 3%

## 2 - Finding Influencers

Deux par Deux found influencers by using [inBeat](https://inbeat.co), an influencer discovery tool because of the number of potential collaborators they needed to contact. Finding 500 influencers by hand is a daunting task they didn’t want to go through (if you want to see how you can find influencers by hand, I recommend [this article](https://www.inbeat.co/articles/finding-instagram-influencers-free/)).

They filtered their search:

* 5k to 25k followers
* Acceptable engagement rate
* Located in the USA or Canada
* Has email

They needed each influencer to have an email because they wanted to contact them in bulk through Mailshake, a cold emailing tool.

They used three search terms: (1) *mother,*(2) *mom*, and (3) *newborn*, independently. The reason they ran a search with the keyword newborn is that they wanted roughly 10 influencers with a newborn child to promote their baby collection.

## 3 - Pitching the Influencers

Once they finished selecting the influencers for their campaign, they exported their campaign to a CSV format, which they imported to Mailshake.

They then wrote their pitch and follow-up sequences (3 follow-ups), and they kicked-off the campaign.

With this sequence, they got 70 collaborators:

At this point, Deux par Deux has negotiated with 90 influencers, 70 have accepted their offer, and they selected their top 60 from those 70.

## Managing Influencers

Once the influencers are chosen, it is now time to onboard them, which means getting the right information, sharing the right information, and giving them the product.

They used a simple Google Form to capture all of the information they needed (email, address, name of their children, etc.) will be more than enough. 

They then setup an autoresponder that triggered when the form was filled out. This message gave the influencer all of the relevant guidelines:

* Content format
* Product Positoning
* How to prepare the image (adding #sponsored to the hashtag, tagging Deux par Deux's Instagram page in the image, etc.)

They then integrated the form to Google Sheets to create their lightweight influencer CRM.

They used this sheet to track:

* Promo codes
* Sales
* Post URLs
* Etc.

## The Results

* Deux par Deux adds 5 new clients per micro-influencer, on average. Given their vertical, the lifetime value of a client is significant.
* Deux par Deux received 150+ pieces of original content in many formats (videos, stories, and images), which they can add to their marketing mix
