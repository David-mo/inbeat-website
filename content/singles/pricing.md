faq:
  questions:
    - answer: >-
        Yes, you can change or cancel your plan at any time in your settings.
        Once you have canceled your plan, you will retain access to your premium
        plan until the end of your subscription cycle. At this point, you will
        be moved to our free plan.
      question: Can I cancel my subscription whenever I want?
    - answer: >-
        We currently support most major credit cards (Visa, Mastercard, and
        American Express).
      question: What forms of payment do you accept?
    - answer: >-
        This depends on the scale at which you want to do influencer marketing.
        Think about how many influencers you want to work with and how many you
        will need to contact. Our experience is that 200 credits is enough for 1
        campaign per month.
      question: How many credits do I need?
    - question: What is a campaign?
      answer: >-
        An influencer marketing campaign usually represents a specific outreach
        effort. For example, you want to outreach 100 potential influencers for
        a back-to-school campaign. It is an easy way to manage the lifecycle of
        your influencer marketing.
    - question: What do I get when I export my campaign?
      answer: >-
        You will receive the following information, if available: Handle, Email,
        Profile URL, Language, Followers, Engagement, Topics, Website.
    - answer: >-
        For each influencer you export in a campaign, you will be charged 1
        credit. If the influencer does not have an email linked to it, you will
        not be charged. If you export the same influencer in multiple campaigns,
        you will only be charged once. If you're on the Free Plan, you still
        can't export contacts without email.
      question: What counts as a monthly credit?
    - question: When do I receive my monthly credits?
      answer: >-
        You receive your credits every month on the date you signed up for your
        paid plan. If you upgrade your plan, you immediately receive the number
        of credits of the new plan.
    - answer: >-
        Our system will warn you if you exceed your plan limit. You will be able
        to upgrade your plan at this stage.
      question: Can I exceed my plan's credit?
    - answer: >-
        We sure do! Contact us directly at david@inbeat.co and we will unlock
        our charity plan for you.
      question: 'We are a charity, do you have any special discounts?'
